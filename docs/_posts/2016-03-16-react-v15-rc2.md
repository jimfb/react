title: "React v15.0 RC2"

Thanks to everybody who has already been testing the release candidate. We've received some good feedback and as a result we're going to do a second release candidate.

Here's a summary of the changes:

* Fixed a critical bug that prevented IE9, IE10, and IE11 from rendering text nodes properly.
* Switched back to using an SVG whitelist instead of passing all SVG attributes directly to the DOM.  This allows us to maintain consistency with the React v0.14 SVG API (`className` instead of `class`, CamelCase props, etc).
* React will no longer append `'px'` to the `borderImageOutset`, `borderImageWidth`, and `borderImageSlice` CSS styles.  Users must explicitly specify the units when passing a value to these styles.
* Fixed a bug that caused server-side rendering to generate illegal markup when the root component's render function returns null.
* Minor improvements to some of our new warnings.
